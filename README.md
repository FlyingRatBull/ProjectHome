Kivy

`http://kivy.org/docs/gettingstarted/intro.html`

 + Supports PC, OSX & Linux as well as all current mobile platforms (iOS & Android)
 - Needs to be set up differently for each OS

Django

`https://www.djangoproject.com/`

 + Simple implementation - works on all OS's
 + Accessible from anywhere (given the correct network configurations of course)
 + GUI is written in html/css - dayum!
 + Lots of features already built-in: models & databases, http requests, testing, cryptography, localization, logging...
 + scalable
 - Most likely slow
